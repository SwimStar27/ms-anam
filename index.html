            <p id="moanapa">If Ms. Anam was a Disney Princess, she would be Moana. In the movie, Moana, she was told to not go past the reefs. However, she still did, and she was very adventurous. This is simliar to Ms. Anam, not that she was told not to go beyond somewhere, but Ms. Anam goes above and beyond. Ms. Anam always showed me how to code a new website, or continue coding a website, and even showed me on a whiteboard if I didn't understand something. Normally, a teacher wouldn't go above and really explain what they are trying to teach a student, but Ms. Anam uses all the tools she ca to teach me and makes me learn what I am supposed to learn for that given class.</p>

        <center>
            <p id="moanapa">If I could describe Ms. Anam with one word, I would use positive. Ms. Anam is postitive because she doesn't say rude or mean things even if I get something wrong or if I even join class late. She is also accepting if I can't make the class on time, and when I was hurt ( when I fractured my elbow ) she was always positive about me getting better and healing quicker.</p>

            <p id="moanapa">If I could describe Ms. Anam as an animal, it would be a manatee. This is because manatees are the most lving animals on Eartg. Ms.Anam is a very loving person who cares for others. When I fractured my elbow, she coded the code for me while I spoke about what I wanted her to code because my elbow hurt. She is one of the most loving person on Earth.</p>
